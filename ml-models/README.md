# ML Model Repository 3.0

This branch contains the third version of the ML Model Repository for the AI-Orchestrator module. It includes additional, more advanced models to expand functionality and improve accuracy.

## Models Included
- **K-means**: Unsupervised learning algorithm used for extracting the key resource features such as GPU utilization, memory utilization, and energy consumption
- **Deep K-means**: Deep K-means enhances the separation of workloads in a lower-dimensional latent space.

## Version Information

- **Version**: 3.0
- **Models**: K-means, Deep K-means

These models extend the capability of the orchestrator to handle unsupervised workload classification and complex time-series data.
