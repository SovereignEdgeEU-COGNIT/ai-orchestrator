# ML Model Repository 2.0

This branch contains the second version of the ML Model Repository for the AI-Orchestrator module. It includes additional, more advanced models to expand functionality and improve accuracy.

## Models Included
- **LSTM**: A Long Short-Term Memory model suitable for time series predictions.
- **GRU**: A Gated Recurrent Unit model optimized for sequence data processing.
- **TCN**: A Temporal Convolutional Network for time-dependent data analysis.
- **FFNN**: A Feedforward Neural Network for general-purpose predictions.

## Version Information
- **Version**: 2.0
- **Models**: LSTM, GRU, TCN, FFNN

These models extend the capability of the orchestrator to handle complex, time-series data.
